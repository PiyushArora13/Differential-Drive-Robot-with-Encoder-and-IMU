# Differential-Drive-Robot-with-Encoder-and-IMU

A high-precision differential drive robot capable of drawing perfect circles and squares, built from scratch during my summer internship.
This project showcases the fusion of PCB design, embedded systems, and control theory, resulting in a robot that thinks before it moves.

🔥 Why This Project Stands Out
🚗 Draws perfect circles and squares using kinematics + PID

🧠 Implements real-time sensor fusion with IMU + Encoder

📉 Designed and applied low-pass filters in Embedded C and Python (Matplotlib)

📐 Created both a Zero PCB prototype and a professional custom PCB using KiCad

🎮 Simulated robot behavior in PyGame using differential drive equations

📊 Verified hardware movements with simulation to ensure precise control
