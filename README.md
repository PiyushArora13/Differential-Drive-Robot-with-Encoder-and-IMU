# Differential-Drive-Robot-with-Encoder-and-IMU

A precision-controlled differential drive robot that can trace perfect circles and squares, built during my summer internship. This project integrates sensor fusion, PID control, and real-time filtering, all backed by professional schematic and PCB design along with a zero PCB prototype.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
‚úÖ KiCad-based professional schematic & PCB design

‚úÖ Zero PCB version for quick prototyping and hardware validation

‚úÖ Integrated MPU6050 IMU, N20 encoder motors, TB6612FNG motor driver, and servo

‚úÖ Low-pass filtering in both Embedded C and Python (Matplotlib) for sensor noise reduction

‚úÖ PID control for precise motion stability

‚úÖ Able to accurately draw circles and squares on flat surfaces

‚úÖ PyGame simulation using differential drive kinematics to verify motion before hardware testing
